# ESLint Indentation Fix Summary

## Issue
The CI/CD pipeline was failing due to ESLint indentation errors. Files had 4-space indentation instead of the required 2-space indentation defined in `.eslintrc.json`.

## Files That Were Fixed
1. `src/utils/logger.js` - 63 indentation errors
2. `tests/handlers/health.test.js` - 28 indentation errors  
3. `tests/services/dynamodb.test.js` - 81 indentation errors
4. `tests/setup.js` - 14 indentation errors
5. `tests/utils.test.js` - 77 indentation errors

## Total Errors Fixed
- **263 ESLint errors** across 5 files
- All indentation changed from 4 spaces to 2 spaces
- Added missing newlines at end of files
- Fixed `space-before-function-paren` issues
- Fixed `no-whitespace-before-property` issues

## Solution Applied
```bash
npx eslint --fix src/ tests/
```

This automatically:
- Changed all 4-space indentations to 2-space
- Added newlines at end of files where missing
- Fixed spacing issues around function parentheses
- Removed unnecessary whitespace before properties

## Verification
✅ All 40 tests passing
✅ ESLint lint:ci check passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
✅ Serverless configuration valid
✅ No breaking changes to functionality

## Current Status
- Local files: ✅ Correctly formatted
- Latest commit (67d563d): ✅ Pushed to origin/dev
- CI/CD Pipeline: Should now pass ESLint checks

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Verify the deployment proceeds without ESLint errors
3. The deployment should complete successfully to AWS Mumbai region (ap-south-1)

## Prevention
To prevent this in the future:
1. Use VS Code "Format on Save" feature
2. Configure editor to use 2-space indentation for JavaScript
3. Run `npm run lint` before committing
4. Consider adding a pre-commit hook with `husky` and `lint-staged`
